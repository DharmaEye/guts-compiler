# Guts

## Little summary
Guts is a small compiler which I've made for fun. It supposed to be an easy tool for excel generation but it's hasn't been finished yet.
I've made it couple months ago but hasn't used for anything and in the end I've decided to publish it. I hope it will help you to learn something new.

*If you think that something could be done in a different way please let me know. Thanks in advance ^_^*

## Architectural view
Coming soon...
